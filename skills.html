                CSS and Examples
                
                I possess a comprehensive understanding of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and have honed my ability to craft visually appealing and responsive web designs. My proficiency extends across various key concepts and techniques, allowing me to create polished and user-friendly interfaces. I combine creativity with a strong grasp of design principles to enhance user experience and aesthetic appeal. Here are some examples that highlight my expertise:
                
                Responsive Layouts: I excel in creating responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. By utilizing media queries, flexible grids, and relative units like percentages and ems, I ensure that websites remain visually engaging across all platforms.
                
               <br> css
                @media (max-width: 768px) {
                    .container {
                        flex-direction: column;
                    }
                }
                Selectors and Styling: I proficiently employ various selectors to target specific elements and apply tailored styles. From class selectors to pseudo-classes, I use CSS rules to define fonts, colors, margins, and more.
                <br>
                css
                .button {
                    background-color: #007bff;
                    color: white;
                    padding: 10px 20px;
                    border: none;
                    border-radius: 5px;
                    cursor: pointer;
                }
                Flexbox and Grid Layouts: My adeptness with Flexbox and CSS Grid allows me to create sophisticated layouts without the need for complex HTML structures. I leverage Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts and CSS Grid for intricate two-dimensional designs.
                <br>
                css
        
                .container {
                    display: grid;
                    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                    gap: 20px;
                }
                Transitions and Animations: I skillfully utilize transitions and keyframe animations to add dynamic elements to websites. This enhances user engagement and provides a more immersive experience.
                <br>
                css
              
                .card:hover {
                    transform: scale(1.05);
                    transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
                }
                CSS Preprocessors: My familiarity with CSS preprocessors like Sass enables me to write cleaner, more organized stylesheets. I use variables, mixins, and nesting to streamline code and enhance maintainability.
                
                <br>
                css
        
                $primary-color: #007bff;
                
                .button {
                    background-color: $primary-color;
                }
                Cross-Browser Compatibility: I'm well-versed in handling cross-browser compatibility issues. I employ vendor prefixes and feature detection techniques to ensure consistent rendering across various browsers.
                <br>
                css
                
                .box {
                    display: flex;
                    display: -webkit-flex;
                }
                My proficiency in CSS enables me to translate design concepts into functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. With an eye for detail and a passion for staying updated on the latest trends, I consistently deliver top-notch user experiences through my CSS expertise.
